# Sleep-Pattern-Analysis

## Audio - Snoring detection model

1. Get the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tareqkhanemu/snoring/data
2. see the sample implementations using the above dataset
3. use cnn and lstm to train the model
4. put the saved model in the models folder - to be accessed by the streamlit app

## CSV - Sleep Factors - detecting sleep anomaly and sleep quality and attributes

1. get the 2 datasets
   - one dataset for sleep anomaly detection
   - one dataset for sleep quality and suggestions
2. Train the model using Random Forest for Numerical Data Classification
3. Use hyperparameters and grid search to increase accuracy
4. save two different models seperately into the models folder

## Front end - StreamLit

1. create a good looking front end using streamlit
2. allow for input of numeric data and audio files of sleep
3. Display the outputs of the models neatly
